            <p className="pageSubtitle">Unharmed is a project still in its infancy.</p>
            <p>It means it's still full of potential to become many different things. When I think about its future, I envision:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">website easy and ejoyable to browse on a smartphone,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">website without trackers,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">website full of harm reduction tools and calculators,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">website with tools helping users to quit substance abuse,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">website where users can share their psychedelic experiences trully anonymously,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">community where members can ask questions without fear of being judged or ridiculed,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">community free of gatekeepers, trolls and gaslighters,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">bridge between vendors and users, creating feeling of individual approach to clients,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">bridge between creators and psychedelic community,</li>
                    <li className="aboutus--li">place where forgotten blogs and forums are getting rediscovered and brought back to life.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>There's plenty of projects, blogs and forums about psychoactive substances, entheogens and psychedelic culture. Unfortunately with Google and Bing algorithm changes it is getting harder and harder for those places to reach wider audience. With the arrival of AI models and <i>"AI answers"</i> a huge part of the Internet will become deserted.</p>
            <p>Information about psychoactive substances, psychedelics and spirituality shouldn't be served by language models. It's too dangerous and sooner or later those topics will disappear from search engines altogether. We need to create our own tools, knowledge repositories and discussion forums.</p>
            <p className="redEmphasis">Without the fear of not being indexed by Google.</p>
            <p>I guess, that's the main motivation behind unharmed. Drug addicts, substance abusers, but also self-taught psychonauts and truth-seekers are struggling to find relevant information through traditional search engines. Information that can potentially save their lives or keep them <i>unharmed</i>, but is being removed from search results to keep advertisers and governement agencies satisfied.</p>
            <p className="pageSubtitle">Stay unharmed!</p>
